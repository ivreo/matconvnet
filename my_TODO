### Normal way to pick the solver / DONE 

  - Solvers are implemented as functions and stored in 'examples/+solver/' (a
    matlab package folder; i.e 'solver.adam' is adam's name in matlab)


### Avoid global variables in cnn_mnist.m 20171029  / DONE

In cnn_mnist, the net and the solver are passed as global variables.
Find the proper passing techniques.

in cnn_mnist.m 
 - opt.network = []


### Clean dagnn.Loss  20171029

For the needs of autoencoders dagnn architecture, the PSNR loss function needed
to be added so as to be defined in a block layer.  However, the psnr definition
was added to dagnn.Loss but should have been added
to vl_nnloss instead.

This would avoid dupplicate code for simplenn and dagnn, and copies of the code
for averaging over the batches.

- check that we can deactivate the averaging of the psnr
