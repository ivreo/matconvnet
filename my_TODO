Find the proper passing techniques.

### Clean dagnn.Loss  20171029

For the needs of autoencoders dagnn architecture, the PSNR loss function needed
to be added so as to be defined in a block layer.  However, the psnr definition
was added to dagnn.Loss but should have been added
to vl_nnloss instead.

This would avoid dupplicate code for simplenn and dagnn, and copies of the code
for averaging over the batches.

- check that we can deactivate the averaging of the psnr
